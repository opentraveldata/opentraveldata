# That directory contains the ORI-maintained data files for the
# Points of Reference (POR) related to travel. For now, it contains only
# the POR having got a IATA code.

##
# The only file to be maintained is the list of best known coordinates, i.e.,
# the ori_por_best_known_so_far.csv CSV data file, which is made of three
# fields:
#  - IATA code
#  - latitude
#  - longitude

##
# The make_ori_por_public.sh Shell script generates the more detailed 
# ori_por_public.csv CSV data file, which is a merge of three POR data files:
#  - ORI-maintained data file: ori_por_best_known_so_far.csv
#  - Geonames data file: dump_from_geonames.csv
#  - (The public part of the) Amadeus RFD data file: dump_from_crb_city.csv

##
# The ori_only_por.csv CSV data file contains (as of March 2012) 106 airports,
# which appear neither in Geonames nor in Amadeus RFD. For instance, some
# Web sites mention AAD as the IATA code of the Ad-Dabbah airport in Sudan.
# However, all those Web sites give unconsistent geographical coordinates,
# and neither of those corresponds to an actual airport (as checked with
# Google Maps, Bing Maps, MapQuest and OpenStreetMap). So, those airports
# are kept in the ori_only_por.csv data file, for reference, with more details
# than in the generated ori_por_public.csv file, at least for some of those
# airports.

##
# By construction, there can be three types of update:
#  - By ORI, within the ori_por_best_known_so_far.csv file,
#    which is the list of the best known coordinates.
#    Note that those changes generally occur when integrating the latest
#    updates from Geonames, thanks to the scripts in the ../tools directory
#    (e.g., update_airports_csv_after_getting_geonames_iata_dump.sh).
#    See the ../tools/README documentation for more details on the corresponding
#    use cases and usages.
#
#  - By Geonames, within the dump_from_geonames.csv file, itself
#    generated by the ../tools/preprepare_geonames_dump_file.sh script.
#    Note that, as the geographical coordinates should have been already
#    integrated within the ori_por_best_known_so_far.csv file, only
#    the POR details (e.g., the name, state, country) should be updated.
#
#  - By Amadeus RFD, within the dump_from_crb_city.csv file. Idem as for
#    Geonames.

##
# The ori_por.csv data file is deprecated, and should soon be removed. It was
# made of a merge of the file of best known coordinates and of the Amadeus RFD
# data file. It did not integrate Geonames information. That is why it has been
# replaced by ori_por_public.csv.
